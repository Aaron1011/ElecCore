/**
 * Created by Elec332 on 14-8-2016.
 *
 * When I was over halfway creating these alleles, I realised that Forestry already had
 * default implementations for almost all of them. When I tried to switch to Forestry's
 * implementations, I saw that some of them had protected constructors, so I decided to
 * continue.
 *
 * Sorry to the Forestry dev's in advance :(
